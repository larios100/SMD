Representing a wave of young artists in the Regional Mexican world, 20-year-old
singer/songwriter Xavi arrives with a refreshing sound that reflects the different cultures
in which he grew up: Mexican and American. His style includes R&B, pop and urban, all
blended with Regional Mexican sounds. After releasing music independently, Xavi
caught the attention of Interscope’s executives, who discovered him through social
media and the rest is history: he is developing a successful musical career hand in hand
with one of the most important labels in global music.

Joshua Xavier Gutierrez Alonso, known as Xavi, was born and raised in Phoenix,
Arizona to Mexican parents. Seeking the American dream, in 2002 his parents
emigrated very young to the United States, where they had their first child and a year
and a half later Xavi was born. “Moving to another country isn’t easy and even more so
if you don't know the language. We were a low-income family but Xavi had a happy
childhood in general, from a young age we instilled in him a love for music, which is why
at Christmas instead of toys we gave him instruments,” says the father of the young
Mexican-American artist.

Influenced by the American culture of R&B and Rap, as well as Pop and Regional
Mexican that his parents instilled in him, Xavi was creating his own musical style,
although it was not until the Covid-19 pandemic that his life was heading towards the
music industry. “I didn't choose my career, it chose me. I always liked music but I saw it
more as a dream and now I am fulfilling it,” says Xavi, who has been playing the guitar
since he was 10 years old.

“Amigos con Derechos,” “Te Quiero,” “Vete Ya,” “Si Me Ven” and “Ojitos de Miel” are
some of the songs that gave him the opportunity and opened the doors to the world of
music putting him in the spotlight of record labels, including Interscope Records, which
signed Xavi becoming his official label. After signing a deal that would take his career to
the next level, Xavi has released several singles including “Quiero Contarte,” “Zero
Sentimientos,” “La Diabla,” “Poco a Poco,” “Modo DND,” and “La Diabla.”
Despite the difficult moments in his life, including his parents' divorce, a rebellious
adolescence that took the wrong path and a nearly-fatal accident in early 2022, Xavi is
now ready to focus on his career. His desire is to help all the people who are going
through hard times and can save them the same way he did for himself.
