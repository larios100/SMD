The musical group, originally from Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico, was founded in December 2013 in the
town of Costa Rica. Over the years, the project has evolved, experiencing changes in its members,
yet steadfastly maintaining its passion and vision. In 2021, the group took a significant leap, gaining
recognition in the music scene and breaking records at major venues, such as the Microsoft
Theater in Los Angeles, California, where they sold 7,000 tickets in less than an hour. This
achievement became a milestone in their journey, reaffirming their place in the music industry.

Currently, the group consists of five talented musicians: Alfonso Favela as the lead vocalist; Jesús
Cuadras on electric bass; César Soto on bajo quinto and backup vocals; Ángel González on drums;
and their newest member, Luis Campos, who joins as accordionist and lead vocalist. United by a
strong vision and relentless determination, the group continues to move forward with the goal of
leaving a lasting mark on regional Mexican music.
